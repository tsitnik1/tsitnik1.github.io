            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I will strive to live a life that brings joy to people whom I know and donâ€™t know. 
                I will do this through helping people when they need it. 
                I hope that through my deeds I will inspire others to do the same and be remembered as someone who loved others. 
                In my career I will commit myself wholeheartedly to completing tasks and assisting others.</p>
